# TriviaSearch

I wanted to learn Python and play around with things, came up with an idea and rolled with it.

This script utilzes Android Debugging Bridge (ADB) to take a screenshot of a certain Trivia Game and uses image manipulation and OCR to use google and recommend the best potential results in usually just enough time to choose an answer. It needs alot of work, i've lost interest, but wanted to share to help others and see if anyone adds to it! The underlying methodolgy I think could be used better elsewhere, but this is what i made with it after alot of playing around and learning. New to programming and python, this is a first for me.
